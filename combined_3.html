between  the  end  of  the  High  Renaissance
in  1520  and  the  beginning
of  the  Baroque  in  1600s
a  good  80  years  has  passed</td><td>这裡现在收藏了

是用来描述17世纪
及18世纪前半的视觉艺术</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:23</td><td>The  word  actually  originated
in  the  subsequent  Neo-Classical  period

whereas  the  Renaissance
and  the  Classical  period  was  concerned
with  harmony
balance  and  proportion</td><td>这个字其实是起源于
之后的新古典时期
用来描述和古典
及文艺复兴艺术相反的东西
文艺复兴时期的艺术
和古典时期的艺术首重和谐
平衡及比例</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:45</td><td>The  Baroque  period  was  concerned
with  antipathies  of  this</td><td>但巴洛克时期的艺术

of  wholeness  whereas  previous
to  the  Baroque  period
the  Renaissance
paintings  tended  to  emphasis  the  idea

the  idea  that  it
was  the  whole  image  which  mattered</td><td>巴洛克时期的艺术活动

is  very  much  more  dynamic

卡拉西因此扬名立万</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:03</td><td>Just  to  execute  such  a  work
on  this  scale  represents
an  enormous  achievement
but  the  actual  figures  depicted
by  Carracci  are  especially  significant
they  rekindle  the  classical  poise

and  are  free
of  the  stylistic  distortion  of
form  that  characterised  much
of  the  Mannerist  art  of  the  time</td><td>光是能完成如此大规模的壁画
就是一项了不起的成就了
但卡拉西描绘出的人像
