<h1>Landmarks of Western Art - Episode 1</h1>
<table>
<tr><td>00:15</td><td>Here we are in the centre of Paris
in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</td><td>西方艺术大师
第一集-后中古时期
我们现在正位于巴黎市中心
圣母堂的前面</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:19</td><td>A truly remarkable monument,
to the power and glory
of the medieval church,
look how it is designed,
it is tall vertical,
declarations draws
the eye upwards towards heaven.</td><td>这是中世纪教堂的代表作
请看看它的设计
其高耸直立的设计
将观者的目光吸引至高空</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:33</td><td>Indeed the medieval church
was the most powerful institution
in Europe at the time
and these constructions helped
to create medieval city.</td><td>的确,中世纪时
欧洲最有势力的组织就是教会
中世纪时的城市
多为此种建筑风格</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:41</td><td>Imagine what it would have been
like coming from
the feudal countryside to
an urban centre like Paris
and finding a construction like this
it is built entirely in stone
and its technology had to be worked out
generation by generation.</td><td>想想看,当时人们从乡下
到巴黎市中心时,心中的感受
看到这种建筑物时
心中应该备受震憾
这种建筑物全为石造
而且建筑的风格是经过
世代传承演化而来</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:56</td><td>And the church's dominance in society
also expressed itself
in the world of art.</td><td>当时教会在社会中的地位
至高无上
同时也对当时的艺术
产生了很大的影响</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:02</td><td>In the early medieval world most of the art
most of the art that was produced
was produced in monasteries
on illuminated manuscripts
and most of the artists were
in fact were manuscript illustrators.</td><td>中世纪早期…
多数的艺术品都是描绘在
修道院中的手稿书本上
当时多数的艺术家都是负责
製作教会手稿的画家</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:15</td><td>Well that period that we understand
as the late medieval
and early renaissance period
is that time
when artist began
to rely more and more on motifs
from the ancient classical world.</td><td>我们所谓的中世纪晚期
和文艺复兴时期早期
是艺术家们开始由
古代的古典世界中
寻求艺术创作灵感的那段时期</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:33</td><td>Specifically they were concerned with
how objects were distributed in space
and moved through space.</td><td>他们特别感兴趣的是
物体在空间中的
分佈及行进状态</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:40</td><td>So essentially what one is seeing
is a move from a God's eye view of
the world to a man's view of the world.</td><td>所以当时人们开始
以人的眼光来看世界
而不光是由上帝的角度
来观察这个世界</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:49</td><td>The anonymous painters and sculptors
of those days
were concerned almost exclusively
with religious themes.</td><td>当时的无名画家及凋塑家
几乎全心描绘宗教主题</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:57</td><td>Their aim was simply to use
time-honoured techniques
to produce images that would
communicate a spiritual message.</td><td>他们沿用了古老的艺术手法
传达出淨化人心的主旨</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:07</td><td>The representation of reality
in the ordinary,
temporal world was not their intention.</td><td>他们完全无意描绘
当时的现实世界</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:14</td><td>But art, and artists,
were about to change for ever,
and the late medieval world
would see the development
of new ideas and techniques
that would lead on to the glory of
the 16th century High Renaissance,
and art as we know it today.</td><td>但艺术和艺术家
即将面临重大变革
我们可以看到中世纪晚期
兴起了一股新的艺术理念
及艺术手法
这股新兴风潮将导致
和我们今日所见的艺术</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:30</td><td>This is the medieval city of Florence
in the centre of the Italian
peninsular with Rome to the south
and Milan to the north.</td><td>这是位于义大利半岛中心的
中世纪城市佛罗伦斯
其南方是罗马,北方是米兰</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:39</td><td>Now Italy in the Thirteenth Hundreds
was a collection
of individual city-states.</td><td>1300年代时的义大利
是许多城邦的组合</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:44</td><td>And there were two types of them.</td><td>城邦一共分为两种</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:46</td><td>One type the 'gibbolene'</td><td>一种被称为「吉伯林」</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:48</td><td>Such as Milan and Sienna took their
charter from the holy Roman Emperor
& in essence they were a feudal society
where power was invested in the King.</td><td>包括米兰和西恩那
它们受神圣罗马帝国的统治
当时的社会动盪不安
而且集权于王室</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:58</td><td>The other type of city such as Florence
took its charter directly from the Pope
and in this sense the Pope was happy to
collect his money from his charter
and leave the people to rule themselves
as they saw fit.</td><td>另一种则像佛罗伦斯一样
直接受到教皇的统治
在这种城市中
教皇只要负责收税
而充份将权力授予地方政府</td></tr>
<tr><td>03:11</td><td>Gradually, secular thinking emphasising
the importance of trade, commerce
and an economy based on money began
to be established.</td><td>这些地方逐渐建立了
强调贸易,商业的思潮
及一个建立于
金钱上的经济体制</td></tr>
<tr><td>03:22</td><td>In England and North-West Europe,
wool and textiles were
a substantial source of new wealth,
while in Italy, with its historic trade
links to the East, merchants,
tradesmen and bankers
began to ply increasingly profitable
trade in urban centres
such as Padua, Siena and Florence.</td><td>在英国和西北区
羊毛和纺织品成为主要的财源
而在义大利
和东方世界间的贸易由来已久
商人,生意人及银行家
开始在城市中建立
获益极高的商业组织
比如在帕杜亚,西恩那
和佛罗伦斯这些城市</td></tr>
<tr><td>03:43</td><td>It was against this new,
secular background that the great
artists of the late medieval world
would achieve their greatest results.</td><td>中世纪的画家
在这个世俗现实的社会中
创作出他们最伟大的作品</td></tr>
<tr><td>03:51</td><td>Another tradition how ever was about
to be started here
is Florence by their master Giotto
and the way he was
to conceive his painting
was to change the history of painting
for the next five hundred years.</td><td>不过另一项传统
就快要在此诞生
始作俑者是艺术大师乔托
他的绘画风格
影响了其后500年间的
西方艺术师</td></tr>
<tr><td>04:05</td><td>Born near Florence around 126 7,
little is known of Giotto's early life
like so many artists of his time,
but between 1302 and 1305 we know
he was working in
the northern Italian town of Padua,
painting the walls
of the Cappella dell'Arena,
using a technique virtually unknown
since ancient times.</td><td>乔托在1267年出生于佛罗伦斯
就像同期的艺术家一样
我们对乔托早年所知不多
但在1302到1305年间
我们知道他在义大利
北方的帕杜亚工作
在为当地的大教堂作画
他所使用的绘画技巧
是当时前所未有的</td></tr>
<tr><td>04:29</td><td>In effect he put away line as
a way of making a painting
and started to use patches of tone.</td><td>他摒弃了
一般作画时的勾勒技巧
而开始使用不同的色调来表现</td></tr>
<tr><td>04:36</td><td>This way of working had hardly been
exploited since Roman times,
in effect he could make an image with
rough areas, rough patches of tone
and by varying them create
much deeper illusions of space.</td><td>这种绘画技巧从罗马时期
就鲜为人知
所以使用这种技巧可以用
不同的色彩,区块
来营造出多变的空间感</td></tr>
<tr><td>04:51</td><td>Giotto rediscovered the fresco,
the method of painting with
watercolours on plaster,
while the plaster is still wet.</td><td>乔托重新使用壁画法
也就是在灰泥上用水彩作画
不过在作画时灰泥仍潮湿未乾</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:00</td><td>Fresco is an extremely durable form of
painting but it is very laborious,
you start with a ground of
rough morsel know as 'arricato'</td><td>壁画法十分持久
不过画起来非常辛苦
首先找一块粗糙的「阿里卡多」</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:15</td><td>And when that is dry you lay
on that a much more smooth
and expensive plaster called the Intoko</td><td>等乾燥之后再涂上一层
比较昂贵而平滑的灰泥</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:25</td><td>Which is made of ordinary Gypsum
and also ground marble.</td><td>这种灰泥的材质为
石膏和磨碎的大理石</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:30</td><td>The key thing is that whilst this Intko</td><td>作画的关键在
趁这层灰泥还没有乾的时候</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:33</td><td>Is wet you design is painted.</td><td>就开始在上面作画</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:37</td><td>The thing to remember with fresco
is because you have to paint on
a wet plaster surface with the intko,
it has to be done quickly,
therefore as a master Giotto
would have had to have been extremely
decisive and deft in the way
that he manoeuvred the brush.</td><td>在作壁画时要记得
因为画家要在
潮湿的灰泥面上作画
所以动作一定要快
所以乔托在作画的时候
下笔一定要熟练,精确
绝对不能有任何疏失,迟疑</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:53</td><td>More remarkable than Giotto's
rediscovery of the fresco technique,
however, were the images
he created using it.</td><td>乔托的伟大之处
不光是在重新找回壁画法
而是他依此法创作出来的作品</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:07</td><td>But it wasn't the subject matter
that made works such as
''The Mourning of Christ'' revolutionary.</td><td>但让「哀悼基督」这类作品
永垂不朽的
不是这些作品的主题</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:12</td><td>Visual depictions of events surrounding
the life of Christ were commonplace.</td><td>描绘基督生平的作品很多</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:17</td><td>But the illustrations of
Biblical events that were created,
mainly for manuscripts,
were simply a means
of communicating sacred themes
to a mainly illiterate world.</td><td>但在教会手稿上描绘
圣经事件的作品
其主要目的不过是为了
描绘圣经上的神圣史实罢了</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:29</td><td>This 12th century German manuscript
illustration of ''The Annunciation''
for example makes no attempt
to represent the Virgin
or the Angel as physically real figures
existing in real space.</td><td>这份12世纪的
德国圣经手捲上的「天使报喜」
根本无意将圣母和天使
真实的呈现在作品中</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:42</td><td>The artist would simply not have been
concerned with this.</td><td>艺术家根本不将这些艺术
列入考量</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:46</td><td>What was remarkable about
Giotto's equally religious work
was that it had spatial depth.
''The Laminatation( not sure check)
of Christ'',
perhaps one of the best known
of Giotto's fresco scenes,
was one of 57 painted to the order
of Enrico Screvini
a wealthy merchant of Padua.</td><td>乔托的宗教作品之所以重要
是因为真实的呈现了空间感
「哀悼基督」
也许是乔托壁画中
最广为人知的作品
这是他为一名帕杜亚富商
所画的57幅壁画中的一幅</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:08</td><td>He guides as to the subject of
the scene mainly the dead Christ
by the gazes and the gestures
of the figures,
even the sky is treated in
a typical Giottesque way no cloud
and perhaps that bears emphasis
to the scene below.</td><td>他利用不同手法将观者的目光
集中在画中的主角身上
比如利用画中人物的目光和姿态
甚至连天空都带有
他独特的风格
在在强调了下方的主角</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:25</td><td>That means that our gaze
is almost inevitably directed
to the principle subject,
by the arrangement of the figures
and their gestures.</td><td>这表示观众在看画的时候
目光会不可避免的
集中在画中的主角上
这就是他利用画中人物
目光及姿态的成功之处</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:35</td><td>The eye takes
in the subject all at once
and focuses straight away
on the principal subject,
which is in this case the dead Christ.</td><td>画中所有人物的目光
都集中在主角身上
而这幅画的主角是死去的基督</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:46</td><td>While there are many aspects
of Giotto's painting
which remain medieval for example
in the landscape of this painting
''The Lamintation''.
Notice how the figures
are fully and round.</td><td>乔托的作品中
虽然仍带有中世纪的风格
请注意画中的人物形态
都丰硕圆满</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:58</td><td>How daring it is,
as it were to allow the ladies
in the lower left
to turn their backs to the surface
of the painting.</td><td>另外一项大胆的创新是
他居然将左下角的女士
背对观众</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:12</td><td>Giotto's frescoes
in Padua and later work
such as his fresco series for
the Church of Santa Croce in Florence
are now considered to form the starting
point of modern Western art.</td><td>乔托在帕杜亚的壁画系列
及稍后他为圣克谢教堂
所画的壁画系列
现在被人视为
现代西方艺术的起点</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:24</td><td>Giotto's work also made him famous.</td><td>乔托的作品使他闻名于世</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:28</td><td>The great writer Dante described him
as the greatest artist of his day.</td><td>但丁认为乔托是当时
最伟大的艺术家</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:33</td><td>The importance of an artist
such as Giotto was,
could be very useful to the patron
because the artist was able to
bring prestige to the patron
and this can be seen in Giotto's work
for the arena chaplain Padula.</td><td>像乔托这样的艺术大师
对当时的买画客户来说
非常重要
因为他们能够彰显
买画者的地位
这可由乔托为帕杜亚牧师
所完成的作品看出来</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:51</td><td>Giotto's fame spread throughout Italy,
and so did his new discoveries.</td><td>乔托扬名全义大利
而他的技巧也一样声名远播</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:56</td><td>In the Tuscan hilltop town of Siena,
a near-neighbour but great rival
of Florence,
the influence
of Giotto made himself felt.</td><td>位于卡斯塔尼山顶的西恩那
是佛罗伦斯的近邻,也是强敌
乔托的影响力在此清晰可见</td></tr>
<tr><td>09:07</td><td>These two cities also competed
in another art form, that of painting.</td><td>这两座城市在绘画上
也互相竞争</td></tr>
<tr><td>09:12</td><td>Now painting did not really come
from Northern Europe
it was essentially an art tradition
that came from the Byzantine tradition,
Greece,
here there was a long tradition
of icon painting,
in which beautiful linear figures
were drawn against the reflective gold
background that sparkled in the light.</td><td>绘画严格说起来
并不是来自北欧
而是拜占庭的
希腊艺术传统之一
当时艺术家热衷于
描绘宗教人物
在金壁辉煌的背景中
呈现出细长的主体人物</td></tr>
<tr><td>09:31</td><td>These icon paintings which were usually
done on panels of wood
with egg tempera painted over them,
were jewel like masterpieces
that were born in the centre of
the interior of Italian church.</td><td>这些作品通常是在木板上
以蛋彩颜料绘画
这些像宝石般夺目的杰作
形成了当时
义大利教堂内部的装饰主干</td></tr>
<tr><td>09:46</td><td>This can be seen in ''The Annunciation''.</td><td>我们可由目前陈列在
佛罗伦斯办公室画廊中的</td></tr>
<tr><td>09:49</td><td>Now on display in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence,
we are once again presented with
the Biblical story of the visitation
by the Archangel Gabriel
to the Virgin Mary.
''The Annunciation'' was
by far his most famous painting,
takes ideas which in some sense
appear rather archaic
but when one looks at is as it pulls
to the earlier work,
to show how he has injected
a quite sense of naturalism
into some of the images.</td><td>「天使报喜」看出这一点
这幅画描绘的是大天使佳百利
前去造访圣母玛丽亚的故事
「天使报喜」是他最着名的作品
这幅作品的主题虽然很老套
但如果和早期的艺术品相比
我们可以看出
他大量的引用了写实主义
来描绘画中的人物</td></tr>
<tr><td>10:27</td><td>With in some of Martiniaes work
we can see that he uses an extremely
elegant sinuous line in his paintings
and that it expressed very
sophisticatedly within the two figures.</td><td>我们在欣赏马蒂尼的作品时
我们可以看到他作画时
採用了优雅柔软的线条
画中的两个人物
清楚的显现了他的风格</td></tr>
<tr><td>10:41</td><td>The way he treats the line
when he paints the figure of Gabriel
is very much more flowing,
very much more sensuous than
the way he treats the line
when he paints the virgin as
because he wants paint the atmosphere
that she is in some way rather
frightened by sudden apparition
and so he makes the figure of the angel
very much more relaxed and calm.</td><td>他画佳百利天使时的线条
非常流畅
而且比画圣母玛丽亚时
感性多了
因为他想营造出一种效果
让观者认为她因这种神蹟
而感到害怕
所以他的天使像
看来较冷静,较自在</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:13</td><td>Due to the elaborate frame however
we must look through
a series of wooden columns,
that stand forward of the painting
and this creates a very interesting
and dynamic space.</td><td>不过画外繁複的边框
使我们不得不透过
一系列的木柱来观赏此画
这营造了一种
流畅,有趣的空间感</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:24</td><td>The immaculate conception,
was as it were a shift from
heavenly space and earthly space.</td><td>他在作画时的理念是
表达出天堂及人间的空间转移</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:30</td><td>And in this painting the frames
has the spatial role
that reiterates and repeats the shift
of heavenly and earthly spaces.</td><td>在这幅画中的边框
在空间上扮演了重要角色
反覆强调了
天堂及人间的空间感</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:39</td><td>We move as it were into
an intermediate space where heaven
and earth touch for
that miraculous moment.</td><td>让看画的人进入了
天堂人间合而为一的神奇境界</td></tr>
<tr><td>11:47</td><td>Although paintings such as
''The Annunciation'',
together with Giotto's earlier work,
represented a genuine step forward
in the artistic representation
of depth and space,
such 14th Century images still
strike us as unsophisticated
in comparison to the great masterpieces
of later times.</td><td>像「天使报喜」
和乔托的早期作品
在表现空间上有了长足的进步
不过和较晚期的艺术作品相较
这些14世纪的艺术作品
看起来仍然十分朴实</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:10</td><td>The problem was that the ability
to authentically reproduce
three-dimensional scenes
on a two-dimensional surface
had not yet been discovered.</td><td>问题出在当时人们
仍然没有研究出
如何二度空间的平面上
真实呈现出三度空间的景象</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:22</td><td>It would be the 15th Century
before it was.</td><td>人们一直到15世纪
才解决了这个问题</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:26</td><td>In the mid-1300s, however,
the Italian artists could be excused
for not concerning themselves
with art technique.</td><td>不过在1300年代中期
艺术家对此技巧毫不关心
也是情有可原的</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:35</td><td>The first half of the 13th hundreds
was a period in which Florence
and Sienna, Martiniae and Giotto,
competed with each other.</td><td>1300年代前半段
是佛罗伦斯和西恩那
马蒂尼和乔托
彼此竞争的年代</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:43</td><td>This period however was bought
to a catastrophic end.</td><td>但这个年代
却有了悲剧性的结尾</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:46</td><td>First there was famine,
then there was a flood
and then worst of all the plague,
came in two different forms.</td><td>首先是飢荒
再来是洪水
最可怕的是瘟疫横行
当时共有两种
可怕的瘟疫在此肆虐</td></tr>
<tr><td>12:54</td><td>Indeed in some of the small towns
around Florence here,
up to eighty percent
of the population died.</td><td>当时在佛罗伦斯附近的小镇中
几乎80%的人口死于瘟疫</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:01</td><td>It marked a drastic period of change
in the Italian states.</td><td>当时义大利城邦
也起了巨大的变化</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:06</td><td>In effect there was a return
to more conservative,
gothic style of painting
and the Renaissance properly
the early Renaissance did not get going
until the fourteen hundreds.</td><td>结果使得人们回归至
保守的哥德式风格
而早期的文艺复兴时期
要到1400年才开始兴起</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:18</td><td>The beginning of the 15th century saw</td><td>15世纪初叶</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:21</td><td>Florence pre-eminent amongst
the northern Italian city-states.</td><td>佛罗伦斯在北方的
义大利城邦中居领导地位</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:25</td><td>In economic terms, the city flourished,
its economical success symbolised
by the golden form,
the most highly regarded currency
in Europe.</td><td>该城的经济欣欣向荣
它的经济成就
由当时欧洲最强势的
翡冷翠货币可见一般</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:36</td><td>It was truly a golden age,
and within this environment
of prosperity,
men began to think back to
a previous golden age,
the glorious days
of ancient Rome and Greece,
much of whose knowledge
had been maintained
by the Arabs as Europe languished
in the Dark Ages.</td><td>当时的确是个黄金年代
而在这个太平盛世
人们开始回想起
早期的黄金时期
也就是
古罗马和希腊的全盛时期
当欧洲陷入黑暗时代时
阿拉伯人保存了
这些古老的知识</td></tr>
<tr><td>13:56</td><td>Florence was a hot bed of activity
in the Fifteenth century
it so happened that the Medici family
who were merchants and bankers
as well as bringing a huge amount
of wealth to Florence
through their fiscal activities,
they were also very interested
in learning,
they were interested
in what was called humanism.</td><td>15世纪时
佛罗伦斯是各项活动的温床
当时极有势力的麦迪西家族
其家族成员多为富商及银行家
透过他们的经济活动
为佛罗伦斯的经济
带来一记强心针
他们同时对学习也极感兴趣
他们对人本主义尤其有兴趣</td></tr>
<tr><td>14:19</td><td>And part of humanism was to develop
an interest in the work of antiquity,
particularly a new discovery
in Latin texts
by writers such as Cicero and Plato.</td><td>人本主义有一部份是对
古老风俗民情的研究
当时人们发现了古代作家
如西塞罗及柏拉图等人的
拉丁文作品</td></tr>
<tr><td>14:32</td><td>The 14th century in Florence
saw the gradual emergence of a new
building in the heart of the city,
the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.</td><td>14世纪时,佛罗伦斯市中心
开始出现了新型态的建筑
如佛罗伦斯的圣母堂</td></tr>
<tr><td>14:43</td><td>By the beginning
of the fourteen hundreds
the builders of the cathedral
in Florence
were in a bit of a difficult spot.</td><td>14世纪初叶
在佛罗伦斯建筑教堂的建筑师
陷入了一个两难的困境</td></tr>
<tr><td>14:50</td><td>They had finished the bulk
of the cathedral
and had left an opening at he crossing
of the church that was so large,
that no technology was available to
build the dome to fill
such a large space.</td><td>他们完成了大教堂的建筑
却无法利用当时的科技
建造教堂所需的庞大圆顶</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:03</td><td>They were keen for the cathedral
to be topped
with a great dome yet no architect
of the age
possessed the technical skills
to carry out the task,
until Filippo Brunelleschi.</td><td>他们担心教堂会因为
无法支撑大圆顶而崩塌
但当时的建筑师都没有
完成这项任务所需的技术
直到布伦内利齐出现为止</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:19</td><td>Trained as a goldsmith,
he became a master architect.</td><td>原来身为金匠的他
成为艺术大师</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:24</td><td>In addition to
mastering Gothic architectural,
he also studied passionately
the structures and techniques
of the ancient Romans.</td><td>他除了身为哥德式建筑大师外
也孜孜不倦的研究
古罗马的建筑技术</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:34</td><td>He was a close friend of Donatallo,
and they went on a very important trip
to Rome at this time.</td><td>他是唐纳泰罗的好朋友
他们当时两人
展开前往罗马的重要里程</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:40</td><td>He noticed some of the Roman buildings
that had fallen down and they had domes
of this sort
but he noticed that
unlike the gothic art there was no
keystone at the top of a roman dome.</td><td>他注意到当时许多崩塌的
古罗马建筑
都有类似的圆顶
但他注意到这些罗马圆顶
不像哥德式建筑一样
顶上有拱心石</td></tr>
<tr><td>15:52</td><td>He began to look more closely
and he discovered that
instead of building tall vertical ribs
that locked at the top,
that the building built by the Romans
were built in effect as a series
of smaller and smaller doughnuts.</td><td>经过仔细观察之后,他发现
罗马式建筑中
并没有高耸的圆拱
而是採用一系列
由大变小的圆型结构</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:05</td><td>Of course the Romans
has a substance called concrete,
the formula at this time had been lost,
but Brunelleschi figured out a way
of laying the bricks out
in herring dome pattern so that
the bricks could be interlocked.</td><td>当然,当时罗马人
建筑的时候使用了水泥
但水泥的配方早已佚失不可考
布伦内利齐想出了以特殊方式
排列圆顶上的砖头
他主要採用交叉排列的方式</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:17</td><td>The dome built in a series of
self- supporting rings.</td><td>好让圆顶上的砖头
支撑自己的重量</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:21</td><td>No wooden frame was necessary.</td><td>完全不需要使用
任何的木造骨架</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:25</td><td>In effect Brunelleschi mixed
the Gothic system ribbed,
which you can still see in the dome
and the circular system of building
which he got from the Romans.</td><td>布伦内利齐融合了
哥德式的圆拱
这点我们仍然由
圆顶的结构看出
但却融入了
古罗马建筑的圆形技术</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:35</td><td>Together he was able to
make a twin mould system,
which allowed him to build,
which still remains today the second
largest masonry building in the world.</td><td>他藉由融合这两种不同的技术
建造了目前仍为世界上
规模第二大的石造建筑</td></tr>
<tr><td>16:45</td><td>Brunelleschi's achievement in
creating the cathedral dome
remains his most enduring achievement
in architecture,
and one still appreciated
by the thousands of people
who visit Florence every year.</td><td>布伦内利齐建筑的教堂圆顶
是他最历久不衰的建筑杰作
每年来佛罗伦斯观光的人
仍然对他的巧思惊叹不已</td></tr>
<tr><td>17:00</td><td>But other buildings designed by Brunelleschi,
such as The Foundling Hospital,
also in Florence,
display the genius of a man who,
while inspired by the classical world
and passionate about their techniques,
sought to create a new architecture
for the new age of prosperity
that he lived in.</td><td>但布伦内利齐其他的建筑作品
如佛罗伦斯的育儿院
呈现了这名艺术天才
在受到古代建筑技术的启发后
如何创出一种新的建筑技术
来因应当时繁荣社会的需要</td></tr>
<tr><td>17:18</td><td>In this building he used

ideas had developed that
these kind of images
could become acceptable.</td><td>当时身为画家的波提契裡

something that is proto scientific,
in other words is was Verocchio's
