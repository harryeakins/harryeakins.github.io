另外一项重大的成就就是
对色彩的运用及视觉的呈现

the  mythology  out  of  painting
to  take  away  some  of  the  old  masters-
some  of  its  sensibility-
some  of  its  mystery  and  magic</td><td>他这麽做达到了将神话
自画作中抽离的效果
将前期大师杰作中的
神话魔幻色彩剥离</td></tr>

fresh  colour
his  seeming  disregard
for  the  rigours  of  linedrawing
