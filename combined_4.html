<tr><td>00:10</td><td>We're  here  in  Birmingham's  Museum
and  Art  Gallery  today  to  talk
about  the  Rococo
and  Neo-Classical  paintings</td><td>西方艺术大师
洛可可时期
我们今天在伯明罕博物馆
谈谈洛可可
和新古典时期的画作</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:17</td><td>Whereas  Rococo  was  the  last  style
of  the  French  monarchy  Neo-Classicism
was  the  first  style
of  the  new  French  Republic</td><td>洛可可是法国王室的末代风格
那麽新古典就是新的
法兰西共和国的艺术风格了</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:26</td><td>Now  Rococo  borrowed  many
of  the  techniques  from  the  Baroque
in  use  of  a  tonal  type  of  painting,
soft  edges,  luscious  colours</td><td>洛可可沿袭了
巴洛克时期的技术和风格
它沿袭了巴洛克柔和的线条
及诱人的色彩</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:37</td><td>If  Baroque  came  from  serious  issues
and  noble  issues  from  the  Bible
and  Classical  issues</td><td>巴洛克时期的绘画主要描述
圣经和古典艺术中的高贵景象</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:43</td><td>Rococo  art  was  quite  different</td><td>洛可可艺术则大相迳庭</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:45</td><td>It  looked  through
a  more  private  refined
and  emotional  experience</td><td>它表达的是更私密
更强烈的感情</td></tr>
<tr><td>00:50</td><td>It  was  full  of  sensuous  delight
it  was  about  love</td><td>作品中充满了感官上的喜悦
它描述的是爱</td></tr>

<tr><td>01:25</td><td>It  is  synonymous  with  the  reign
of  Louis  XV</td><td>它的时代相当于
路易15的执政时期</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:29</td><td>It  comes  out  of  the  Baroque  style
but  then  the  17th  century
was  a  very  dynamic  movement</td><td>它起源自巴洛克风格
但巴洛克在17世纪
是一项重大变革</td></tr>
<tr><td>01:38</td><td>When  we  come  into  the  18th  century
in  Rococo
it  takes  this  dynamism
from  the  earlier  period  and  refined
it  rather  into  delicate  swirls
and  curling  designs
feathery  patterns
so  it  is  a  much  more  elegant  style
rather  more  court  style
than  the  earlier  work</td><td>但在进入18世纪时
洛可可艺术
将前期艺术改造昇华
成为一种更精美
更柔和，充满曲线的艺术风格
所以洛可可是一种
更为优雅的艺术风格
和前期艺术相比
它充满了宫庭艺术风格</td></tr>
<tr><td>02:01</td><td>The  point  about  the  Rococo
I  think  is  that
it  shows  actually  hedonistic  lifestyle
-  an  enjoyable  lifestyle  -
and  many  people  made
their  fortunes  invested
in  this  style  as  well  because
it  wasn't  heavy  -
it  was  a  kind  style  that  we  could  live
with  in  a  celebrated  life</td><td>我认为洛可可艺术的重点在于
它呈现了享乐主义-
一种纵情娱乐的生活形态-
当时许多有钱人都为了
过这样的日子
不惜花费大笔金钱
因为这种生活轻鬆，愉悦
充满了对生命的礼讚</td></tr>

have  a  precise  meaning  which  relates

was  being  produced  during  this  period</td><td>「洛可可」这个字

did  have  a  precise  origin</td><td>不过，「洛可可」这个字的来源
非常清楚</td></tr>

which  was  a  word
to  describe  a  decoration</td><td>它来自「rocaille」

features  of  French  palaces  and  houses</td><td>也就是法国宫庭

<tr><td>02:52</td><td>The  art  which
was  produced  during  this  period
like  its  name  suggests,
was  quite  ambiguous</td><td>这个时期的艺术作品

of  different  types  of  ideas
with  an  emphasis  on  decoration</td><td>作品中包含了
许多不同的创作理念

and  parts  of  Cupid</td><td>这个时期的许多作品
看起来没有什麽意义
多强调琐碎小事和肤浅的娱乐
如竖琴和邱比特等</td></tr>

to  describe  a  style  of  architecture,
painting,  sculpture
interior  design  and  even  music</td><td>「洛可可」这个字
很快的就流传开来
用来描述当时的建筑物
画作，凋像
室内设计，甚至音乐的风格</td></tr>
<tr><td>03:26</td><td>In  painting,  especially
the  works  of  the  rococo  age  present  us
with  an  idealised  world  of  pleasure

music  and  human  figures
in  dreamlike  poses  living  as
it  were  without  a  care  in  the  world</td><td>尤其是在绘画方面
「洛可可」这个字是用来描述

on  his  so-called  '  Fetes  galantes'

in  which  ladies  and  gentlemen
of  society  pass  their  time  away
in  beautiful  gardens  and  landscapes
individuals  whose  only  worries,  if  any
concern  the  ever-important  business
of  love
'  Fete  in  a  park',
one  such  scene  produced  in  1719
provides  a  wonderful  example
of  Watteau's  approach</td><td>在他创作了「野宴图」后
声名大噪
这幅画描述了
上流社会的绅士淑女们
在美丽的花园风光中
悠閒的打发时光
看来画中的人无忧无虑

试着取悦对方，并进行配对</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:19</td><td>In  lots  of  Watteaus,  if  you  like,
this  pairing  off  is  very  prominent</td><td>在华铎的作品中
常常可见到这种配对场景</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:24</td><td>What  we  also  find  in  a  lot
of  Watteau's  paintings  is  these  statues</td><td>我们在许多华铎的作品中
也可看到他对凋像的描绘</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:28</td><td>These  statues  very  often
they  appear  alive  particularly
in  the  park  the  statue  is  round

the  idea  that  love  is  progressing</td><td>这些凋像常常看来栩栩如生
在这个公园裡的凋像
看来十分清醒

浪漫情事正在进行</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:40</td><td>So  if  the  statue  is  sleeping

then  the  process  of  love  could  carry  on!</td><td>如果凋像睡着了
表示有问题发生
但如果凋像醒着的话
爱情可以不受阻碍的进行</td></tr>
<tr><td>05:51</td><td>The  curiosity
of  Watteau  which  makes  him  different
from  any  of  the  other  Rococo  painters
painters  like  Boucher  and  Fragonard
is  that  Louis  XIV  style  -
Louis  XIV  period  in  which
the  elite  lived  such  a  rarefied  life  -
is  that  they  had
so  much  done  for  them  -
all  they  had  to  was  live
this  very  much  more  grandiose  life</td><td>华铎之所以和其他的
洛可可艺术家
像布谢歇，富瑞格纳等人
不同的原因是
路易十五的风格-
路易十五的时期
当时的贵族不食人间烟火
什麽事都有别人代劳
他们唯一要做的就是
过着奢华的日子</td></tr>
<tr><td>06:24</td><td>The  problem  with  that,
which  Watteau  was  able  to  show
was  that  then  becomes
a  rather  aimless  life
because  there's  nothing  to  strive  for
in  life  and  what  we  see  in  the  painting
is  they  spend  all
of  their  days  dressing  up
living  this  life  playing  in  the  park</td><td>我们可由华铎的作品中看出
这种日子的问题就是
久而久之就开始变得毫无意义
因为生命失去奋斗的目标
我们可由这幅画看出这点
画中人物终日打扮
过着在公园中玩乐的日子</td></tr>

of  aimlessness</td><td>但仍然有股漫无目标的感觉</td></tr>

they  are  going  nowhere</td><td>他们觉得自己的生命没有出路</td></tr>

could  only  see  the  surface
could  only  see  surface  glitter</td><td>但那个时期的画家
多半只看到奢华的表面</td></tr>

there  was  another  side  to  what  appeared
to  be  a  perfect  life</td><td>但华铎却让看画的人感受到
那种看似完美的生活
也有阴暗面</td></tr>
<tr><td>07:12</td><td>Watteau's  '  Fete  Venitienne'  provides
another  memorable  painting  of  gay
carefree  life
and  includes  amongst
its  fashionable  figures
a  bagpipe  player</td><td>华铎的「欢宴图」
也是一幅令人难忘的
充满快乐，无忧的杰作
而在画中，衣着入时的人群中
有一名风笛演奏者</td></tr>

of  Watteau's  finest  works
along  with  clowns,
but  in  his  true  masterpiece
'  Departure  from  the  Island  of  Cythera',
it  is  love,  and  lovers
that  provide  the  subject  matter</td><td>华铎的佳作中常常可以看到
音乐家和小丑的身影

「离开希塞拉岛」中
主题则是爱情和情侣</td></tr>

about  to  depart  from  the  island  after

画中人物正准备离开这座岛
想当然耳，他们在岛上
度过了充满阳光
爱情和音乐的一天</td></tr>

other  than  a  sense

in  a  Watteau  such  as  this
although  some  critics  feel
he  also  succeeds  in  capturing  a  sense
of  melancholy</td><td>像这样的华铎名作中
我们只能说它传达了
一种经过理想化的纯粹欢迎
有些画评家也认为
他同时也成功的营造出
一股忧鬱的气氛</td></tr>

at  the  inevitable  passing  of  time
which  cannot  be  avoided
even  in  a  setting  such  as  this</td><td>也许是对年华老去
油然而生的忧鬱
就算是在如此美景中
也无法避免</td></tr>
<tr><td>08:17</td><td>Perhaps  Watteau  himself  knew  that
he  did  not  have  long  to  live</td><td>也许华铎自己已经预见
来日无多</td></tr>

he  died  of  tuberculosis
at  the  age  of  37</td><td>在创作这幅画后四年
他便因肺结核与世长辞

born  a  generation  after  Watteau

而她的影响力让布歇终于当上
法国国王的御前画家</td></tr>

and  '  Reclining  Girl'</td><td>布歇笔下的裸体人物总是温暖
充满感官

a  goddess  from  mythology

an  image  of  one  of  Louis  XV's
other  mistresses</td><td>前者画的是神话中的女神
而后者我们几乎可以确定
画的是路易十五的另一位情妇</td></tr>
