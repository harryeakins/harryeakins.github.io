creating  it</td><td>当然在艺术方面也不例外

a  whole  model  of  behaviour  and  action
which  couldn't  explain  war,  honour

and  it  was  people  who  were
at  the  core  of  Romanticism</td><td>古典派首重行为和动作

拿破崙时期的
战争,恐惧和屠杀

the  first  step  to
identifying  these  themes

which  included  for  example
the  legendary  tales  of  King  Arthur

<tr><td>02:44</td><td>Romanticism  was  the  dominant
artistic  movement  of  the  19th  century

diverse  as  Byron,Wordsworth  &  Beethoven
worked  within  the  Romantic  tradition</td><td>浪漫主义是19世纪艺术的主流

masterpieces  sought  it

it  was  something  larger  than
life  itself
that  Romanticism  tried  to  refer  to</td><td>但另一方面

the  individual
who  was  existing  beyond  the  bounds

that  of  a  personal  response  to  things
a  personal  response  to  landscape  -
a  personal  response  to  events  -
of  great  emotional  events
that  happened  at  the  time
so  that  because  it  was
a  personal  response  each  artist
produced  work  which
while  belonging  to  a  Romancist  ideal,
was  individual  to  themselves</td><td>浪漫主义的哲学
就是个人对事物的反应
个人对风景的反应-
